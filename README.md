# IISxpress
A Deflate/GZIP/BZIP2 compression plugin for Microsoft's IIS Web Server

This is the complete source code for IISxpress, a compession plugin for IIS. It runs under Windows Server 2003 and 2008. You'll need Visual Studio 2005 to build it.

I'm releasing this now for posterity since it is unlikely to be useful as a product.
