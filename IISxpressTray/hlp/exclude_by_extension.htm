It is almost always possible to determine the contents of a file from its file extension. It is a 
fairly sound assumption that a file with the extension HTM or HTML always contains HTML markup, a file 
with the EXE extension is executable and a file with the extension TXT will be plain text.

IISxpress does not treat content created static or dynamically differently. If a request for and ASP or 
ASPX file creates compressable content and that extension is not excluded then it will be compressed.
</p>

<p>
Files have compression characteristics related to the data they contain. For example, text files compress 
very well since they usually contain repetative sequences of characters, however files that contain 
highly random data sequences do not compress well, in fact these files may even be larger after compression 
than they were originally.
</p>

<p>
Extension exclusion rules are ideal for excluding files which will not compress well. Typically JPG files 
are already well compressed (this is not always the case though), so it is likely that you will want to 
define an exclusion rule for this file type.
</p>

<p>
When IISxpress processes a response it determines whether the extension specified in the request is excluded 
from compression. If it matches then the response will not be compressed by IISxpress.
