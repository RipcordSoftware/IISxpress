<div class="paragraphheading">What is it?</div>

<p>
IISxpress is an HTTP compression plug-in for IIS 7.0, 6.0 and 5.1. IISxpress 
installs a filter module into your IIS server configuration, this module 
intercepts responses from IIS and compresses them on-the-fly reducing bandwidth 
usage and improving site responsiveness.
</p>

<p>
A typical HTML file will reduce in size by between 50% (2:1) and 75% (4:1); XML 
files can be reduced by as much as 90% (10:1).
</p>

<div class="paragraphheading">How does it work?</div>

<p>
The IISxpress filter intercepts IIS response traffic, it then passes the data to 
the IISxpress Server which performs the compression and returns the data to the 
client.
</p>

<p>
The IISxpress Server uses its powerful rule engine to determine whether the response should be compressed. 
If the response matches any of the exclusion rules in the database then the response will not be compressed.
The rule engine supports exclusion by file extension, content type, URI and IP address.
</p>

<p>
To prevent your web server from becoming overloaded IISxpress evaluates whether there is sufficient CPU 
and memory resources available to handle each response. If the server is highly loaded IISxpress will  
stop compressing responses until the high load period has ended.
</p>

<div class="paragraphheading">How do I see what IISxpress is doing?</div>

<p>
IISxpress comes with a status and configuration tool called the <b>IISxpress Status 
Window</b>. This installs itself in your system notification bar, simply 
double click to activate it. From here you can see the number of responses 
processed, the compression ratio and other useful information about IISxpress.
</p>

<p>
IISxpress also exposes a set of performance counters which you can view and log via the Windows PerfMon tool. For more
information click <a href="PerfCounters.htm">here</a>.
