<p>
On systems with more than one CPU or CPU core IISxpress uses the <b>Processor Workload Model</b> setting to determine how to divide the compression 
tasks between the CPUs and/or CPU cores of your computer. Three settings are available, <b>Automatic</b>, <b>Manual</b> and <b>None</b>.
</p>

If your system has one CPU with one core the Processor Workload Model setting is ignored.

The diagram above shows a system with a single CPU with four cores. In <b>Automatic</b> mode IISxpress allocates
a core for each request/response processed. In this example IISxpress receives four requests each of which is allocated
a seperate CPU core. The effect of this is that four requests/responses can be compressed simulaneously.
</p>

<p>

IISxpress schedules compression tasks across the available cores in a round-robin fashion. Hence in the above example
request 1 maps to core 1 and request 2 to core 2. Request 5 will map to core 1 since there are only four available 
cores.

</p>

<p>
<img src="images/processor_workload_twocores.png" alt="In Manual mode only the configured cores are used."/><br />
The diagram above shows a system with a single CPU with four cores as before. In <b>Manual</b> mode IISxpress
allocates a core for each request/response from the configured set of CPU cores. In this example IISxpress is configured
to use only core 1 and 3, core 2 and 4 will not be used by IISxpress and can therefore be allocated to other tasks on
your system like running a database or housekeeping tasks.
</p>

<p>
If you configure your system to use <b>Manual</b> mode the operating system will schedule the compression workload. The
effect of this will most likely mean that all available cores participate in compressing each response. This setting
may be faster when dealing with only one request at a time but when deployed in a multi-client environment it will
be less effective when dealing with many simultaneous requests. It is for this reason that <b>Manual</b> mode is not
recommended.
