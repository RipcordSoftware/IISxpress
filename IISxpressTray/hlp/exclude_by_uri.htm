See how to add a URI exclusion rule. Click here to view the tutorial.

<p>
All requests made to a web server specify a URI, this is the portion of the request specified after 
the hostname. For example, http://www.ripcordsoftware<b>/downloads/example.zip</b> is a URL which 
contains the URI <b>/downloads/example.zip</b>.
</p>

<p>
IISxpress does not consider the filename in the request to be part of the URI, and so in this case the URI 
is treated as just <b>/downloads</b>. IISxpress supports the exclusion of whole directory structures 
with URI exclusion rules.
</p>

<p>
Since a URI is web site specific IISxpress allows you to specify rules on a per web site instance basis. If, 
for example, your web server is configured with two web sites www.abc.com and www.xyz.com, then you can 
specify a set of URI rules for each site. Extension and Content Type rules are applied to all web sites on 
the server, URI rules are specific to the site where they are defined.

<p>
With IISxpress you can specifiy that a specific directory (or web folder or virtual directory) is to be 
excluded from compression. This rule can be extended to include all child directories if desired.
</p>
<p>
The picture on the right shows an example web server directory structure. The IISHelp directory has been 
excluded with a wildcard rule, this approximates to an exclusion rule of <b>/IISHelp/*</b>. When this rule 
is applied all content under the IISHelp directory will not be compressed (denoted by the red font).
</p>
<p>
In contrast the directory Printers has been excluded but its children will still be compressed. All other 
directories on this web server are candidates for compression.

To exclude an entire web site instance from compression you simply apply a wildcard exclusion rule on the 
root directory. All requests to this site will match the rule and will not be compressed.
