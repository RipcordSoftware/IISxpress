<p>
The compression cache helps to speed up processing of static data (HTML, JS, CSS, XML, etc.) files on your 
web server. When the cache is enabled all compressed static response data is cached to allow it to be retrieved 
as quickly as possible.

The diagram above shows a request from a client. Firstly the cache is queried to determine whether it contains the correct 
response data. In this example the cache is empty, the request is passed to the compression engine which compresses the response.
The compressed response data is placed in the cache and then returned to the client. The next request for this same data can now be 
resolved solely from the cache.

<p>
<img src="images/cache_hit.png" alt="The request resulted in a cache hit. The response data was retrieved directly from the cache." /><br />
The diagram above shows a request from a client being resolved by the cache. In this example the compressed data is retrieved from 
the cache and not compressed again. Retrieving compressed data from the cache is significantly faster than re-compressing it.
</p>

<p>
When compressed response data is held in the cache all requests for that data from all clients are resolved by the cache. For example, 
if 100 clients request the same compressed response data only the first request will result in the data being compressed. 
The subsequent 99 clients will receive the cached compressed data.
