<p>
The compression cache helps to speed up compression processing of static data (HTML, JS, CSS, XML, etc.) files on your 
web server. When the cache is enabled all static data is cached to allow it to be retrieved as quickly as possible.
The cache is enabled by default.
</p>

<p>
When an uncached response is compressed by IISxpress it is added to the compression cache. The next time that
page is requested the cache will retrieve the data from the cache rather than recompressing it. Compressed
response data reteived from the cache is processed much faster than normal; the response can be processed up to 10
times faster.
</p>

<p>
When the <b>Enabled Compression Cache</b> option is checked the compression cache is enabled, it is disabled when unchecked.
You can enable or disable the compression cache at any time.
</p>

<p>
You can control the amount of memory used by the compression cache by entering the number of KB to use. You
cannot enter a value higher than 10% of your computer's physical memory. The default setting for this option
is 16384 KB (16 MB).
</p>

<p>
The total number of compression responses can also be specified. If the number is too high the cache becomes
less efficient since it will take longer to locate the data. The default value is 200.
</p>

<span style="clear:both;"></span>

<p>
The cache may be flushed by pressing the <b>Flush</b> button. All compressed responses held by the cache will
be removed. The now empty cache will continue fill up with compressed responses as before.
</p>

Response data that is created dynamically by technologies like ASP.NET, ASP, CGI cannot be cached by IISxpress since 
the data will be different each time it is returned.
