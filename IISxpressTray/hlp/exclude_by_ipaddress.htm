<p>
All  requests sent to the web server include the IP address of the client computer making the request. 
IISxpress supports exclusion rules based on the source IP address, this allows you to exclude individual 
clients or groups of clients on an IP subnet.
</p>

<p>
If you have a web server which is serving clients on a number of different network types, for example LAN, 
WAN, VPN (dialup, ADSL, etc.) or internet then you may wish to exclude certain client types from compression. LAN 
clients are connected on a fast network and will therefore receive little benefit from compression, however 
WAN, VPN and internet clients are usually on much slower networks and can benefit significantly from 
compression.

<p>
The picture on the right shows four excluded networks. All requests with the IP prefix 10, 172.16, 
172.17 and 192.168.0 will be excluded from compression. A request from 172.18 will be compressed as
will all other requests not matching this list.
</p>
<p>
If you wish you can also specify an individual IP address to match, for example if you were to add 
a rule for 192.168.1.23 then it would be excluded whereas all other computers on that network would not.
