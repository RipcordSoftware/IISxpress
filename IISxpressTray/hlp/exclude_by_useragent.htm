<p>
When clients (browsers, web crawlers, etc) request content from web sites they identify themselves to the web server via the 
User Agent directive of the HTTP request header. The User Agent directive consists of a string of identifiers which can be 
used to identify the type of the client (for example: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, etc). 
</p>

<p>
There are cases where support for HTTP compression was not been correctly implemented in the client which results in malformed
page rendering by the client. In these cases IISxpress can be instructed to exclude these clients from compression.
</p>

<p>

User Agent strings identify the type of the client, its version number and extensions or plugins 
which are installed. The majority of clients will send useful information in this field.
</p>

<p>
When User Agent rules are enabled IISxpress will not compress requests from the clients specified in the User Agent rule list. To define User Agent
rules click the Add button and select a Predefined User Agent or alternately you can specify a custom string if you cannot
find a suitable match.

<div class="paragraphheading">User Agent Matching</div>
<p>
IISxpress uses a simple matching scheme to enforce exclusion rules. To understand how matches are performed you need to understand 
the format of User Agent strings.
</p>

<p>
User Agent strings consist of one or more PRODUCT and/or COMMENT blocks, where the product block is a section of text containing no 
whitespace characters and a comment block is enclosed in brackets, for example:
</p>

<ul class="squareitem">
<li>Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0)</li>
<li>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; en-US) Gecko Firefox/3.0</li>
</ul>

<p>
As can be seen above there can be multiple PRODUCT and COMMENT blocks in the User Agent string. The key to identifying a given browser
is selecting which elements are always present from the optional and less important elements.
</p>

<p>
If the two browser strings in the example were the only two that existed (in reality there are thousands of combinations) then IISxpress 
would understand the following rule as an exclusion of the first string:
</p>

<ul class="squareitem">
<li>Mozilla (MSIE)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The match is made as follows: <b>Mozilla</b>/4.0 <b>(</b>compatible; <b>MSIE</b> 7.0<b>)</b>. The text in bold shows the characters in 
the string that are matched. The second string would not match since it does not contain (MSIE).
</p>

<p>
The site <a target="_blank" href="http://whatsmyuseragent.com">whatismyuseragent.com</a> is a useful way to determine the user agent strings of your favourite browsers.
</p>

<div class="paragraphheading">Exclusion Rule Forms</div>
<p>
IISxpress supports two types of User Agent rules which when combined allow you to define a powerful set of rules which 
allow you to maximize user agent compatibility.
</p>

<p>
When no User Agent rules are defined or when User Agent rules are disabled all requests will be compressed (unless other
rules exclude them). When enabled you define User Agent rules in the following way:
</p>

<ul class="squareitem">
<li>
	Exclude - excluded User Agents are not compressed by IISxpress. 
</li>
<li>
	Include - included User Agents are always compressed unless another rule type is matched.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Include rules allow you to specify exceptions to general User Agent exclusion rules. Consider the following two rules:
</p>

<ul class="squareitem">
<li>INCLUDE: Mozilla Firefox</li>
<li>EXCLUDE: Mozilla</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since most User Agent strings start with Mozilla the exclusion rule will prevent most browsers from being compressed. However 
since there is an inclusion rule specified for Firefox only those clients will receive compressed responses.
</p>

<p>

User Agent exclusion rules are evaluated by comparing the include rules before the exclude rules. This ensures that clients matching 
include rules are always compressed.
