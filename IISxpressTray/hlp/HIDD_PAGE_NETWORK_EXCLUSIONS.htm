<p>
The <b>Networks</b> window displays a list of IP addresses that IISxpress will not compress. 
These addresses can represent networks or computers.
</p>

<p>
The local computer (the computer running IIS and IISxpress) is treated as a special case. You would 
not normally want to compress responses to this computer since this will cause an unnessesary load 
on the CPU and will probably result in a slower browsing session. However, if you want to test your 
compression configuration then unchecking <b>Exclude compression requests from the local computer</b> 
will allow compressed responses to be returned.
</p>

<p>
You can exclude networks or even individual computers by adding their IP address into the exclusion 
list. To do this press the Add button and enter an address. For example to exclude all clients from 
the network 192.168.0 from receiving compressed responses then type that address into the edit box 
and press enter. Now any requests from that network, say from client 192.168.0.27 will not be 
compressed.
</p>

<p>
Network exclusion is useful since you may know that certain networks attached to your web server will 
not benefit from compression, therefore to reduce the CPU overhead it is best to exclude these networks.
