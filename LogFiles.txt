This file is written to this directory by the IISxpress installer. 

When you enable logging in IISxpress this directory will be populated with log files. 

If you enable ISAPI filter logging and the file is not written to this directory check 
that the web server has permissions to write to this directory.

If you are running IIS 6.0 or 7.0 then ensure that the NETWORK SERVICE account has "Full
Control" permissions. If you have created application pools with custom identities
then please ensure that the identity account also has "Full Control" permissions here.
